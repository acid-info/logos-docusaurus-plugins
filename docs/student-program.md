# Codex Students Program

## About Status

Status is an organization building the tools and infrastructure for the advancement of a secure, private, and open web3. We have been completely distributed since inception. Our team is currently 100+ core contributors strong and welcomes a growing number of community members from all walks of life, scattered all around the globe. We care deeply about open source, and our organizational structure has a minimal hierarchy and no fixed work hours. We believe in working with a high degree of autonomy while supporting the organization's priorities.

## About Codex

The Codex team is working on a next-generation storage engine that attempts to “untie the knot” of incentivized storage. We’re building Codex to be a reliable and predictable p2p storage infrastructure that will allow for many business and casual use cases. We rely on strong data possession (PoR and PDP) and incentive schemes to guarantee long-term persistence and data availability.

## Students Program

This program is available to undergraduate and graduate students officially enrolled in a university, pursuing their B.Sc. or M.Sc. in the field of Computer Sciences or a related domain. The duration of the program could be between 3 and 6 months.

## Bonus if you have

* Distributed system
* Storage and I/O
* P2P networking
* Analytical modeling
* Scalable simulations
* Data analytics
* Parallel programming
* Stress testing
* Continuous integration
* Technical writing

The Codex Student Program aims to do research and development in, but not limited to:

* P2P and distributed computing scheme: leader election, consensus algorithms
* Proofs of (non-)inclusion, retrievability proofs, availability proofs, fraud proofs
* Game theory, incentivization, tokenomics
* Decentralized storage systems, erasure coding, and storage related proofs
* Storage performance measurement and testing

> The above is not a requirement we’d still love to hear from you anyway if you think you’d be a great fit for this role!
