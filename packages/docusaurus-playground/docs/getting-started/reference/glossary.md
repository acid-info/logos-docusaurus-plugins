# Waku Docs Glossary

Definitions and usage of the terminology used in the Waku ecosystem.

### Bootstrapping

Bootstrapping is the initial entry point of a [node](#node) to the [Waku network](#waku). Once connected, other [peer discovery](#peer-discovery) methods can be employed to establish connections with fellow peers.

### [Content Topic](/getting-started/concepts/content-topics)

A content topic is a string attached to [messages](#waku-message) to enable [protocol-level](#protocol) features like selective message processing and retrieval based on specific criteria.

### [Dappnode](https://dappnode.com/)

Dappnode is an open-source platform that simplifies the hosting and management of decentralized applications and blockchain nodes, including [Waku](#waku).

### [Discv5](/getting-started/concepts/peer-discovery#discv5)

Discv5 is a [peer discovery](#peer-discovery) mechanism using a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) to store [ENR](#enr) records, providing censorship resistance, load distribution, and enhanced network resilience.

### [DNS Discovery](/getting-started/concepts/peer-discovery#dns-discovery)

DNS discovery is a [peer discovery](#peer-discovery) mechanism that allows the retrieval of an [ENR](#enr) tree from the TXT field of a domain name, enabling the storage of [node](#node) connection details and promoting decentralization.

### [ENR](https://rfc.vac.dev/spec/31/)

Ethereum Node Record (ENR) is a specification used to represent and identify [nodes](#node), facilitating [discovery](#peer-discovery) and communication within the network. Besides connection details, `Waku ENR` also includes node configuration information like enabled protocol and shards.

### [Filter](/getting-started/concepts/protocols#filter)

Filter is a [protocol](#protocol) that enables [light nodes](#light-node) to selectively subscribe to specific [messages](#waku-message) transmitted by [peers](#peer) using [content topics](#content-topic). It is designed to be a lightweight alternative for accessing the [Relay](#relay) network.

### [GossipSub](/getting-started/concepts/network-domains#gossip-domain)

GossipSub is a [protocol](#protocol) for efficient and scalable information dissemination in decentralized networks commonly used in blockchain systems.

### Light Node

A light node is a [resource-limited](#resource-limited) device or client that leverages service nodes to access the [Relay](#relay) network.

### [Light Push](/getting-started/concepts/protocols#light-push)

Light push is a protocol enabling [light nodes](#light-node) to send [messages](#waku-message) to the [Relay](#relay) network and receive acknowledgments confirming that a [peer](#peer) has received them.

### Mostly Offline

Mostly offline devices refer to clients who spend most of their time offline or disconnected from the network but occasionally connect for certain reasons. Examples include browsers and mobile phones.

### Node

A node is a device or client that implements Waku [protocols](#protocol) and leverages the [Waku network](#waku) to enable secure and private peer-to-peer Web3 communication.

### Payload

The payload field in a [Waku Message](#waku-message) contains the application data, serving as the business logic message transmitted between clients over Waku. Applications can encrypt the payload or employ encryption methods specified in [Waku Message Payload Encryption](#waku-message-payload-encryption).

### Peer

A peer refers to other [nodes](#node) and participants of the [Waku network](#waku) with whom communication and interaction are possible.

### [Peer Discovery](/getting-started/concepts/peer-discovery)

Peer discovery is the process where a [node](#node) locates and connects with [peers](#peer) to establish communication and exchange information.

### [Peer Exchange](/getting-started/concepts/peer-discovery#peer-exchange)

Peer exchange is a [peer discovery](#peer-discovery) mechanism that enables [light nodes](#light-node) to request and receive peers from other nodes in the network, allowing them to bootstrap and expand their connections without depending on [Discv5](#discv5).

### [Protocol](/getting-started/concepts/protocols)

A protocol is a set of rules that enables [nodes](#node) within the [Waku network](#waku) to perform various functionalities such as message sending, relaying, filtering, storing, retrieving, and more.

### Pub/Sub

Publish/Subscribe (Pub/Sub) is an asynchronous messaging pattern where publishers send messages to topics, and subscribers receive messages from topics of interest, allowing efficient one-to-many communication.

### Pub/Sub Topic

A Pub/Sub topic is a string that serves as an identifier for the topic of interest among [GossipSub](#gossipsub) peers. Peers interested in the same topic are likely to maintain a connection and forward messages received on that topic.

### [Rate Limit Nullifiers](https://rfc.vac.dev/spec/32/)

Rate Limit Nullifiers (RLN) are a construct based on zero-knowledge proofs that provide an anonymous rate-limited messaging framework, preserving message owner anonymity while preventing spam or DoS attacks.

### [Relay](/getting-started/concepts/protocols#relay)

Relay is a [protocol](#protocol) that extends the [GossipSub protocol](#gossipsub) to enable secure and censorship-resistant [message](#waku-message) dissemination among [peers](#peer) while preserving privacy.

### Resource-Limited

Resource-limited refers to environments or devices restricting available resources, including bandwidth, CPU, memory, disk, and battery power.

### [RLN Relay](/getting-started/concepts/protocols#rln-relay)

RLN Relay is an extension of the [Relay protocol](#relay) that uses [Rate Limit Nullifiers (RLN)](#rate-limit-nullifiers) to prevent spam economically by enforcing bandwidth caps, imposing penalties, and facilitating network removal for spammers.

### [SDK](/guides/sdks-and-nodes)

SDKs are tools, libraries, and resources to integrate Waku's private, secure, and censorship-free communication features into various applications.

### [Store](/getting-started/concepts/protocols#store)

Store is a [protocol](#protocol) that enables the storage of relayed [messages](#waku-message) in the network, allowing offline peers to retrieve missed messages upon reconnecting to the network.

### [Transport](/getting-started/concepts/transports)

A transport is a network mechanism that establishes connections between [peers](#peer) and enables efficient transmission, routing, and delivery of data packets.

### Waku

Waku is a family of private, secure, decentralized, and peer-to-peer Web3 communication [protocols](#protocol) designed to operate in [resource-limited](#resource-limited) environments and suitable for [node](#node) or desktop application use. Additionally, these protocols collectively form the Waku network.

### [Waku Message](/getting-started/concepts/protocols#waku-message)

Waku Message defines the structure of messages in the [Waku network](#waku), including the [content topic](#content-topic), [payload](#payload), and metadata for application-specific processing.

### [Waku Message Payload Encryption](https://rfc.vac.dev/spec/26/)

Waku Message Payload Encryption provides guidelines for implementing secure and private communication in the [Waku network](#waku). It covers encryption, decryption, and signing methods for message [payloads](#payload), focusing on confidentiality, authenticity, integrity, and unlinkability.

### [Waku Noise](https://rfc.vac.dev/spec/35/)

Waku Noise is a specified way to use the [Noise Protocol Framework](http://noiseprotocol.org/) to build protocols that enable secure key-exchange mechanisms for encrypted communication with confidentiality, authenticity, integrity, strong forward secrecy, and identity-hiding properties.
