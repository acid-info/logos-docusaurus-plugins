### 2013

The Ethereum White Paper was published, unveiling the holy trinity of Web3, comprising:

- Ethereum for consensus.
- Swarm for decentralized storage.
- Whisper for peer-to-peer messaging.

### 2015-2018

The development of the Whisper protocol lagged behind the advancements made by the Ethereum EVM and Swarm, primarily because there was no dedicated team working on building the protocol.

### 2018

Due to the lack of progress made on Whisper and growing concerns around scalability, [Vac](https://vac.dev/) was established to focus on researching and developing more scalable peer-to-peer messaging solutions.

### 2020

`Waku v1` replaces Whisper as the messaging protocol in Status, resulting in the following:

- Enhanced performance.
- Better scalability.
- Ability to work in resource-limited environments.
- And many more.

### 2021

`Waku v2` releases with a fully revamped suite of protocols that not only supersedes but also surpasses the performance of `Waku v1`.

### Present Day

Waku has continued to evolve and enhance itself, solidifying its position as the standard for Web3 communication.
