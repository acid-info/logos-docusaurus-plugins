# JS-Waku Documentation

[JS-Waku](https://github.com/waku-org/js-waku) is the TypeScript implementation of the Waku protocol,
specifically designed for the browser environment.
This powerful, easy-to-use library enables you to integrate Waku into your web applications seamlessly.

:::info

If you wish to use Waku with a NodeJS application, you can either:

- Use [nwaku](https://github.com/status-im/nwaku)'s [JSON RPC API](https://rfc.vac.dev/spec/16/)
- Or, attempt to use go-waku's [c-bindings](https://github.com/waku-org/go-waku/tree/master/examples/c-bindings) in NodeJS

:::

To get started, the [Quick Start](/) guide offers a simple way to integrate Waku into your web app.
For a more comprehensive tutorial, follow the [Build a Chat App](/) guide,
which demonstrates how to create a chat app from scratch.

Explore the [js-waku-examples repository](https://github.com/waku-org/js-waku-examples) to find various working Proof-of-Concepts that showcase how to use JS-Waku effectively.
You can also interact with these examples live:
