It can be used for archival nodes, but that's a different use case.\r\n- The mempool will have a focus on privacy, likely being threshold-encrypted. \r\n- Ideally, the mempool guarantees data availability (ie like Narwhal), and the consensus will operate on the hashes of the mempool.\r\n",

What do you think about changing assertions to Err?\r\n\r\nThe asserts are there to verify the public API contract is respected (i.e. some functions have preconditions that allow you to call them only when certain statements are true). We could also make them errors instead, the important thing is that we filter those cases at some point (either before feeding them to the engine or at the engine by returning errors instead). ",
